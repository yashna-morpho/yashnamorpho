            Disney is synonymous with children's and family entertainment. “Disney strikes a deeper chord in American consciousness than any of the other studios,” Neuman said. “There's this deep nostalgia. You experience these films as a child, and then you are watching your own children see them.” It was founded by Walt Disney and his brother Roy as Walt Disney Productions in 1929 to incorporate their cartoon animation studio. It produced short and full-length animated cartoons in the 1930s and 1940s, then expanded in the 1950s to make nature documentaries and live-action films as well as television programs.

        </p>Disney's mission is to entertain, inform, and inspire people around the world through storytelling. Walt Disney, the company's founder, was an American producer and showman who was famous for pioneering animated cartoon films and creating characters like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. His creativity, vision, and business acumen have influenced audiences of all ages for generations.
